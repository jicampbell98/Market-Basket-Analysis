# Market-Basket-Analysis

Data for this educational project was obtained from the Market Basket Analysis dataset in Kaggle, which was made available by Aslan Ahmedov. The dataset can be found at the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis/code

Notes: The Jupyter Notebook contains the full market basket analysis. GitHub's rendering of Jupyter notebooks is static, which means interactive features of the notebook such as the choropleth map, will not be displayed directly on GitHub.
